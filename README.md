It is written with React in a popular in that time approach - using class components.

This app is considered to be optimised, edited and fixed _to be a perfect piece of art_ (kidding).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with hotreload.<br>

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Do this when need to deploy to github pages

**Make sure you completed `npm run build` before `npm run deploy`**
